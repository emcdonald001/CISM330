		<p>From a young age, I have been someone that has wanted to do things that would result in the joy or satisfaction of others.</p> 
		
		<p>At age 13, my first job was as a baker for a local bakery. I had quite a bit of difficulty picking up routines and procedures in baking the many different products that we sell. Once I was able to get my confidence and skill up, I enjoyed the compliments that I received from the owners of the bakery, and the customers.</p>
		
		<p>Another job that I have had at the beginning of my career was in retail, as a bicycle technician. This job was very valuable to me, because I was able to build bicycles and ride ons for my young customers. Seeing the joy in them after receiving one of those items as a gift, or after I was able to repair an item that was broken has been one of the greatest joys of my life.</p>
		
		<p>As a technician, I have been able to do many things, from helping a customer upgrade their home theater setup in their living room, or help a business display vital information on screens in their living room, and helping teachers, students, and executives have the ability to teach, learn, and conduct business during a global pandemic.</p>
		
		<p>Although the list that I have provided seems extensive, there is quite a bit more I have done for others, and I am no where near stopping in my quest to help others succeed.</p>
