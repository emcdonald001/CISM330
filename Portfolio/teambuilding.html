		<p>Many people believe that hard work and true accomplishment is achieved in individual progress and accomplishments. Although it feels good to that individual, the reach of success is limited, due to the fact that the work that one person can accomplish can be limited.</p> 
		
		<p>I believe in teambuilding because having a different opinion or point of view to see helps to broaden one's thinking to help them develop different ideas that hold more value and would make a bigger difference in their goal.</p>
		
		<p>The goal of teambuilding is to turn an impossible task into something that is acheivable with the combined effort of everyone on that team. </p>
		
		<p>When a team is at it's peak, it will ensure the success and growth of your company, those it serve, and the individual sucess of those involved.</p>
