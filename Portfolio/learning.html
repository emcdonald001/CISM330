		<p>The life of a technician is one that requires the ability to learn every day. We learn that although things may seem the same in our work, there are variables that can cause different results in our work, and that there are many outcome that we need to prepare for.</p> 
		
		<p>Technicians that are good at what they do know that they must be a resource to others, and know that the others on their team are a resource to them. Teamwork and trust are the greatest things that I have seen within the groups that I have been a part of.</p>
		
		<p>In addition to learning in school, and in the field, I have incorporated many of the thought processes I have used on the job into managing my life. It has allowed me to build structure and to think things through rationally, and build myself to not make the same mistake twice.</p>
		
		<p>In the last three years of my life, I have learned to build structure in a time that seems to be chaotic, and finting strength I never knew I had.</p>
