		<p>For some, professional success might come easy. For others, success comes after a series of trials that will test their mental and physical fortitude.</p> 
		
		<p>After I attended ITT Technical Institute, I was excited to start on a path into a career of technology. Since my education was based on electronics theory and hardware, I could not find a good fit, because I needed more guidance for a good start in the industry.</p>
		
		<p>Discouraged, I decided to give retail leadership a chance, because I was very good with operating a retail store, leading, and training at that point so i beganto expand my role there. After several years without any opportunities to advance my career, I realized that I was in a situation where fraternization and favoritism decided who would advance in my former company. Out of frustration, I finally began my career to seek knowledge as a technician.</p>
		
		<p>I started my career as a technician as an audio/video technician. It does not sound like much, it was great helping people at home and businesses be able to entertain themselves and present information at enhanced levels. Personally, this experience helped me learn valuable information about the structures of countless types of homes and builidings.</p>
		
		<p>In my next stop in my career, I worked in telecommunications for multiple companies. In this part of my journey, I helped people bring television, telephone service and internet service to many. This role helped me gain engineering knowledge of how signals are carried along networks and I discovered to many ways that field technicians are counted on to work in homes to establish and repair the networks that the services run on.</p>
		
		<p>My telecommunications career seemed to be my avenue to finally having rapid and steady advancement. I immediadely began to study to pass proficiency exams and applied knowledge session, and had been promoted two times in the course of the year, and waiting to be promoted for a third until a devastating knee injury on the job prevented me from returning to work as a cable technician.</p>
		
		<p>After the rehabilitation of my knee was complete, I wondered what I could possibly do successfully, as I worked as an electromechanical assembly technician, which was a job that challenged my intellect, but did not match activity that I loved.</p>

		<p>One day, while looking on indeed.com, a found a job listing for a 'travelling IT consultant and installer.' I wondered what the logistics would be like in travel, and figured a change of pace like this role could not hurt. It turns out that the job that I have found would be the one that I have needed for a long time.</p>

		<p>This new role that I was in would not seem like it in description, but it utilized all of the skills that I have learned in my former roles as a technician, and I was able to show my proficiency right away. As I began, I was offered a chance to gain education at Point University through a partnership. Not knowing that I would be promoted straight to the top as a Master Technician and Trainer 12 months after I began at Point University, it has turned out being the most challenging stretch of my life, but I have taken it as a challenge from God to learn strength, and to improve prioritization throughout all aspects of my life. I will rise to the challenge. </p>
