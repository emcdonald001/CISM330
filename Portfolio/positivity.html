		<p>I have always found myself in a positive state of mind through the struggles in my life. I do not know how I have come to develop this frame of mind, but it has kept me in a position to not dwell on a negative thought, and to keep moving forward.</p> 
		
		<p>We all have been in situations that have affected us, and we must have the wisdom, strength, and purpose to process and confront these situations so that we can move past these situations stronger. </p>
		
		<p>We all have our own ways maintaning and showing positivity. We all must find ways to make these feelings prevail for the wellbeing for ourselves and the ones we love.</p>
		
		<p>I have been through many lows in my life up to this point, but I did not show in my social life and professional work ethic. My strength has pushed me into some of the best success that I have ever had in life.</p>
		
		<p>I now have professional success that has helped me eliminate debt and move into the next stage of my life, an opportunity to earn a degree to accomplish more in life, and many more positive vibes and thoughts to drive me into the future.</p>
		
		<p>I only wish that my story can inspire more to forge their own path of positivity into a bright future.</p>
